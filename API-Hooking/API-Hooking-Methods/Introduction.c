	Explaination API Hooking:
	- API Hooking is a technique used to intercept and modify the behavior of an API function. 
	- API hooking hooking involves replacing the original implementation of an API function with a custom version that performs some additional actions before or after calling the original function.

	There are two common methods for API hooking: Trampolines (Method 1) and Inline Hooking (Method 2).
    
    Trampolines (Method 1):

        Definition:
            A trampoline is essentially a small piece of code, often referred to as shellcode, designed to redirect the execution flow to another specified address within the process's address space.

        Implementation:
            The trampoline shellcode is inserted at the beginning of the target API function, effectively "hooking" it.
            This modification allows the trampoline to intercept the function call, execute additional actions, and then pass control to the original function or redirect it elsewhere.

        Execution Flow:
            When the hooked API function is called, the trampoline shellcode is triggered instead of the original function.
            The trampoline can perform custom actions and then either resume the execution of the original function or divert the flow to a different location.

    Inline Hooking (Method 2):

        Definition:
            Inline hooking involves intercepting the API function and then allowing the execution to return to the legitimate function seamlessly.

        Implementation:
            It is a more intricate process compared to trampolines but is considered more efficient.
            Instead of completely redirecting the execution flow, inline hooking modifies the existing code of the target function in-place.

        Execution Flow:
            The hook is injected directly into the function code, allowing it to intercept the function call and execute additional code.
            After the custom actions are performed, the control is returned to the original function, allowing for normal execution to continue.
