/*
Explaination:
	- CRT (C Run Time) Library:

    - Overview: CRT, or C Run Time Library, constitutes a fundamental collection of low-level functions and macros essential for standard C and C++ programs.

    - Functionality: This library encompasses crucial operations such as memory management, string manipulation, and input/output functions.

    - DLL Naming Convention: The dynamic link libraries (DLLs) associated with CRT adhere to the nomenclature "vcruntimeXXX.dll," where XXX denotes the version number of the CRT library.

    - Linking in Compilation: During compilation, the compiler incorporates these DLLs into the Import Address Table (IAT) of the generated program.

/*
Additional Compiler Changes

1. Disable C++ Exceptions 
	- Is used to generate code to correctly propagate exceptions.
	- C/C++ -> Code Generation -> Enable C++ Exceptions

2. Disable Whole Program Optimization
	- Disabling this provides complete control over the compiled code
	- C/C++ -> Optimization -> Whole Program Optimization

3. Disable Debug Info
	- Removes the added debug information
	- Linker -> Debugging -> Generate Debug Info
	- Linker -> Manifest File -> Generate Manifest
