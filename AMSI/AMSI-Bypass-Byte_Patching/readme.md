# Introduction
Using byte patching as an evasion technique to bypass AMSI is a well-known method.

## Patching AmsiOpenSession

- The AmsiOpenSession WinAPI creates an AMSI session that can be used to conduct multiple scanning operations. 
- Before applying any patches, it is crucial to gain a thorough understanding of how the API functions and familiarize oneself with its possible return values. 

- Upon researching we can see it jumps and sets AmsiOpenSession to `E_INVALIDARG;One or more arguments are invalid.` this causes AMSI te terminate the process
