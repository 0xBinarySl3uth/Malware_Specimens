/*
 * Explanation:
 *  Protocol handlers serve the purpose of linking an application with a particular protocol scheme.
 *  Protocol handlers ensure that when these schemes are utilized, they seamlessly integrate with the associated application for execution.
 *  In Windows OS, a protocol handler is registered using the Windows Registry.
 *

    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes - This key stores the protocol handler registrations for all users on the machine. This key requires administrator privileges to be modified.

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes - This key stores the protocol handler registrations specific to the currently logged-in user. If the same key is registered in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes and HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes, then HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes takes precedence. This key does not require administrator privileges to modify.
