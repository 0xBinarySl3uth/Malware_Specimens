/*
 * Explanation:
 * - CreateFileMappingW function creates a file mapping object that provides access to the contents of a file through memory mapping techniques.
 * - It allows a process to create virtual memory space that 'maps' the contents of a file on disk into memory.
 * - In this case, it creates a shared memory region that other processes can access.
 *   The file mapping object is not associated with an existing file on disk (INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE).
 * - The mapped memory is set to be executable, readable, and writable (PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE).
 * - The size of the mapping is set to the size of the shellcode.
 *   "0xBinary" is the name of the file mapping object.
