/* Explaination: 

   - Syscalls in the Windows operating system serve as a crucial interface, allowing programs to interact with the system by requesting specific services.

   - Examples of these services include tasks like reading and writing to files, creating new processes, and allocating memory.

   - Consider the example of the NtAllocateVirtualMemory syscall, which is invoked when the VirtualAlloc WinAPI function is called. In this process, the syscall conveys user-provided parameters from the function call to the Windows kernel. The kernel then executes the requested action and returns the result to the program.

   - Syscalls offer low-level access to the operating system, providing developers with more flexibility compared to standard WinAPIs.

   - Two types of syscalls exist: Nt and Zw. Nt syscalls act as the primary interface for user-mode programs, while Zw syscalls are utilized in kernel mode, primarily by drivers and other kernel-mode code. Notably, Nt and Zw versions of the same syscall share the same function address, underlining their functional equivalence at different privilege levels.

   - Each syscall is identified by a unique Syscall Service Number (SSN), which the kernel uses to distinguish between different syscalls.

   - The structure of a typical syscall involves setting up registers with necessary parameters, loading the SSN into the `eax` register, and executing the `syscall` instruction to transition to kernel mode.

	mov eax, SSN

/*
	Direct Syscalls
		- Obtaining a version of the syscall function coded in ASM and calling syscall directly from within the ASM file.
	
	Indirect Syscalls
		- Indirect syscalls are implemented similarly to direct syscalls where the ASM files must be manually crafted first. The distinction lies in the absence of the syscall intrsuction.
		- Indirect syscalls uses jumped to function.
